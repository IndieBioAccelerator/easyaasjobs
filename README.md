Code for finding/organizing jobs on the AAS job register.

Author: Brendan Griffen (@brendangriffen)  

Disclosure: code is based on https://github.com/gully/AASjobRegister 
            but with many more personal modifications.  

Select your options below for one of your possible future career paths... 

Some instructions.

1. Select the career options you would like to query.
2. Select your display options. Note: it is best to just do a full query on
   your keywords first, then from the in-browser table, select jobids (1st column)
   which are of interest to you. Add those job ids to the job_ids_filter below.
3. Re-run code with your jobids selected and create your deadline plot.
